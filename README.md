It's a contest that consists of some typical programming challenges, and other challenges that don’t include any hints and can be quite tricky, so you’ll really have to give your brain a workout! You can choose the programming language or technique you prefer for each challenge. And remember that it’s not a speed competition, so the quality of your solutions, code, and algorithms really matter!
